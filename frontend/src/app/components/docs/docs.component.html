            <p class="faq-question">What is Mempool?</p>

            <p>Mempool is a block explorer for Bitcoin and some of its Layer 2 networks like Liquid and Bisq.</p>

            <p>Mempool is not a Bitcoin mining pool. Mempool is also not a wallet.</p>

            <p>Like many other block explorers, Mempool merely provides data about the Bitcoin network. It does not "control" the Bitcoin network in any way, and it cannot help you make or change Bitcoin transactions.</p>

            <p class="faq-question">What can I do on the Mempool website?</p>

            <p>Mempool's real-time metrics and visualizations can help you understand the Bitcoin network in a variety of ways.</p>

            <p>Some examples:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>see status of your Bitcoin transactions</li>
              <li>see how long a transaction may take to confirm</li>
              <li>get suggestions for fee-rate (s/vb) based on how quickly you need a transaction to confirm</li>
              <li>see Layer 2 Bitcoin network metrics (e.g. Liquid, Bisq)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Much of Mempool's data is available freely for casual use through <a [routerLink]="['/api']">an API</a>.</p>

            <p class="faq-question">I'm having issues with a transaction. It's taking a very long time to confirm, or Mempool can't find it at all. What can I do?</p>

            <p>If you need support for a specific transaction, you must work with the entity who helped you make that transaction (wallet software, exchange company, etc). Mempool can only help you see data about these transactions.</p>

            <!--<p>With that said, this is our #1 support question, so here is a [collection of advice you might find helpful](https://mempool.space/docs/using-mempool/troubleshooting-transactions).</p>-->

            <p class="faq-question">Can I self-host Mempool?</p>

            <p>Yes! Mempool is free/libre open-source software, and it's built to make users sovereign so they don't have to trust anyone.</p>

            <p>You can host your own Mempool instance in a variety of ways for a variety of use cases. Many people find it easiest to run Mempool on a full node solution like Umbrel, RaspiBlitz, and myNode. Depending on your needs, you can also run Mempool on a custom Linux or FreeBSD setup.</p>

            <p>See more details <a href="https://github.com/mempool/mempool#installation-methods" target="_blank">on GitHub</a>.</p>

            <p class="faq-question">I'm having issues with my self-hosted Mempool instance. Can you help?</p>

            <p>Many issues can be solved by making sure you're running the latest official release of Mempool, and making sure both Bitcoin and Electrum are fully synced. Keep in mind that Electrum can take another day or so to sync <span class="italic">after</span> Bitcoin Core has finished syncing.</p>

            <!--[See docs](https://mempool.space/docs/using-mempool/self-hosting/troubleshooting) for more in-depth troubleshooting on supported platforms like Umbrel, RaspiBlitz, or myNode.-->
