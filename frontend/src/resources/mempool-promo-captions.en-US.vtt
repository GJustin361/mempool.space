Welcome to mempool space, an open source project
that provides data and tools to take your

2
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.570
bitcoin experience to the next level.

3
00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.860
Our mempool dashboard provides an at-a-glance
look at the realtime status of a bitcoin node’s mempool.

4
00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.800
View bitcoin blocks through our one-of-a-kind
visualization.

5
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:23.255
Forecasted mempool blocks appear to the left
of the white line, and confirmed blocks to the right.

6
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.960
Take a peek within a forecasted mempool block
for a more granular view, including a visualization

7
00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.120
of included transactions.

8
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.710
Drill down into the details at the transaction level.

9
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.350
And with real-time tracking, you can see the
moment a transaction confirms!

10
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.460
If your transaction funds a new Lightning
channel, you can see various details about

11
00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.719
it on our new Lightning network explorer.

12
00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:51.289
The mempool dashboard also includes a fee
estimation widget that helps take the guesswork

13
00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:54.989
out of choosing an appropriate fee for your transactions.

14
00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.069
For miners, we’ve built a bitcoin mining
dashboard that provides meaningful metrics

15
00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:05.480
including fee and subsidy data, difficulty
and hashrate stats, pool dominance, and more.

16
00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:09.720
Our historical graphs bring all of this data
together and display it across time through

17
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.280
beautifully rendered visuals.

18
00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.350
Mempool space doesn’t have any advertisements
or third-party tracking.

19
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.620
Still, trusted third parties are security
holes, and the most private way to look up

20
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.570
your own addresses and transactions is through
your own bitcoin node.

21
00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.170
We make this easy -- you can install your
very own instance of mempool space with just

22
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.490
1 click on raspberry pi full node distros
like Umbrel, RaspiBlitz, Start9 EmbassyOS,

23
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:42.250
and more -- or, for advanced users, install
our pre-built docker images on your own server.

24
00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:48.206
Additionally, mempool space is integrated
into a growing number of popular wallets and exchanges.

25
00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.626
Explore the full Bitcoin ecosystem, with data
from testnet, signet, liquid,

26
00:01:53.626 --> 00:01:56.360
and now the lightning network.

27
00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.840
Tap into a powerful suite of tools that reveal
useful information about the bitcoin network.

28
